Example
=============

This example shows how easy it is to create a model-class and to work with it.

Files:
- exampleModel.cs -> The Model
- program.cs -> The Main Function
- db.sql -> The SQL Command for creating the used table

In the main function it does the following things:
- Connecting to the database
- Read all entries and print them out
- Change one and insert a new one
- Read all entries and print them out (again)
- Finally closing connection
